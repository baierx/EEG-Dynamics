# # Networks with Python
# ## NetworkX
# 
# [__NetworkX__](https://networkx.org) is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.
# 
# To use NetworkX and visualise your networks, you can import the whole package.

# In[11]:


import networkx as nx


# In[ ]:


# Create Graphs

NetworkX has built-in function to produce basic and classic graphs. 

## Complete Graph

A complete graph is a network where all nodes are connected to every other node. The complete graph is undirected. 

nodes = 10

G = nx.complete_graph(nodes)

layout = nx.spring_layout(G)

nx.draw_networkx(G, pos=layout)


# ## Random graph
# 
# A random graph is a network where edges are added according to an edge probability to each node. The edge probability of the Erdos-Renyi graph is drawn from a normal distribution with a specified mean. 
# 

# In[13]:


nodes = 100

edge_probab = 0.1

ER = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(nodes, edge_probab)

layout = nx.spring_layout(ER)

nx.draw(ER, layout)


# _edge_probab_ controls the probability of assigning an edge. 
# 
# edge_probab = 0: no edge
# 
# edge_probab = 1: complete graph
# 

# ## Directed Random Graph
# 
# In a directed graph, the directionality is indicated by an arrowhead on the edge. 
# 

# In[14]:


nodes = 5
edge_prob = 0.2

ER_dir = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(nodes, edge_prob, directed=True, seed=111)

layout = nx.circular_layout(ER_dir)

# nx.draw()
nx.draw_networkx(ER_dir, layout,
        node_size=1000,
        node_color='r',
        with_labels=True,
        arrowsize=20)


print(ER_dir.nodes, '\n', ER_dir.edges)

nodes = 120
neighbours = 8
alpha = 0.2

ws = nx.watts_strogatz_graph(nodes, neighbours, alpha, seed=111)

layout = nx.spiral_layout(ws)

#nx.draw(ws, layout,
#        node_size=700,
#        node_color='tomato',
#        with_labels=True
#       )

nx.draw_networkx_nodes(ws, pos=layout, alpha=1, node_size=200, node_color='cornflowerblue', node_shape='o')
nx.draw_networkx_edges(ws, pos=layout, alpha=.8, edge_color='tomato', width=1);


# ## Nodes and Edges information

# In[16]:


print(ws.nodes)
print('')
print(ws.edges)


# # Network Quantification

# ## Degree
# 
# Each node within a graph has a number of edges connected to it and this number is referred to as the node (or vertex) **degree**. 
# 
# In directed graphs (or digraphs) the degree can be split into the **in degree** which counts the number of edges pointing *into* the node and **out degree** which counts the number of edges emanating *from* the node. 
# 

# In[18]:


node = 11

print('Degree of node', node, 'is', ws.degree[node])
print('')
ws.degree


# ## Degree distribution
# 
# It is straightforward to look at the degrees of a network with only a few nodes. However, for large networks with many nodes, the degree will be an array with as many numbers as there are nodes. This requires a more convenient way to summarise this information. An often used solution is to look at the _degree distribution_. 
# 
# The degree distribution is normally presented as a histogram showing how many times a given degree was found in that network.

# In[17]:


from matplotlib.pyplot import subplots

fig, ax = subplots()

ax.plot(nx.degree_histogram(ws), '-*');
ax.set_xlabel('Node Degree')
ax.set_ylabel('Degree Count ');

show()


# In a __directed__ network the number of incoming connections is called the __in degree__ and the number of outgoing connections is called the __out degree__.
# 
# Thus, in an undirected network __in degree = out degree__.
# 
# Here is a more complex example:
# 

# In[20]:


nodes  = 100
probab = 0.02

G = nx.gnp_random_graph(nodes, probab, seed=1)

from matplotlib.pyplot import axes, axis, title

import collections

degree_sequence = sorted([d for n, d in G.degree()], reverse=True)  # degree sequence
degreeCount = collections.Counter(degree_sequence)
deg, cnt = zip(*degreeCount.items())

fig, ax = subplots()

ax.bar(deg, cnt, width=0.80, color="b")

title("Degree Distribution", fontsize=20)
ax.set_ylabel("Count", fontsize=16)
ax.set_xlabel("Degree", fontsize=16)
ax.set_xticks([d for d in deg])
ax.set_xticklabels(deg);

# draw graph in inset
axes([0.4, 0.4, 0.5, 0.5])

G.subgraph(sorted(nx.connected_components(G), key=len, reverse=True)[0])

pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=2)

axis("off")

nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, node_size=30, node_color='r')
nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos);

# This example plots the degree distribution, showing, for example, that 11 nodes in this network have no edges (degree = 0). You can verify that from the overlaid graph.
# 
# Note how the degree with highest probability (2) reflects the choice of edge probability of 2%.
# 

# ## Clustering coefficients
# 
# As an example of a more complex quantitative measure, we will look at the clustering coefficient.  
# Look at its formula below and consider extreme cases to understand what useful information the measure is supposed to convey. 
# 
# The clustering coefficient $C_i$ of node $i$ is calculated as:
# 
# $C_i = \frac{2\cdot n_i}{k\cdot(k-1)}$
# 
# where $n_i$ is the number of connections between nearest neighbors of node $i$; and $k$ is the number of nearest neighbors of node $i$.
# 
# The formula is derived as the number of edges between the neighbours divided by the maximally possible number of connections. The maximal number of possible connections of $k$ neighbours is $\frac{ k(k-1)}{2}$. There are $k\times k$ elements but if we leave out self-connections it becomes 
# $k\times (k-1)$. As each edge is included twice (forward and backward) division by 2 gives the number of undirected connections.
# 
# This yields some important properties: if there is no connection between any of the neighbours, then $e=0$ and $C_u = 0$. If all neighbours are maximally connected (each node connected to every other node), then 
# $e=\frac{ k(k-1)}{ 2 }$ and $C_u = 1$. 
# The clustering coefficient therefore tells the extent to which neighbours of a node are connected among themselves. This definition is valid for undirected networks with no self-connections.
# 
# You can obtain the clustering coefficients in a Python dictionary using `clustering`. To extract the clustering coefficients from a graph as a Python list:

# In[31]:


node = 0

print('CC of node', node, 'is', nx.clustering(ws, node))
print('')
cc_dict = nx.clustering(ws)

cc_list = [cc for cc in cc_dict.values()]

around(cc_list[:10], 2)


# And similar to the degree, for large networks, it can be meaningful to plot the distribution of clustering coefficients:

# In[36]:


fig, ax = subplots(figsize=(4, 2))

ax.hist(list(nx.clustering(ws).values()), color='b');
ax.set_xlabel('Clustering Coefficient')
ax.set_ylabel('Count');

show()


# Random and regular graphs have analytical distributions against which empirical distributions can be compared.
